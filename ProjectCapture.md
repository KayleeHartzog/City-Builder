# Project Capture Document for (Title of Project)
#### *Author: Kaylee Hartzog*

## Background
This is a project to help me practice data sturctures.

The goal is to take a file containing information such as Country, State Name, City Name, and Population, and compose them into an array of objects.

<!-- 

Explain the context of the problem.
Explain key terms/words, words that may be unfamiliar to a new hire.


Do Example: 
    
    Corey and his team have been manually going through the html for all images in canvas and filling in the alt attribute. This has been very time consuming. 
    - Alt image text, also called "image alt text", or just "alt text", is the text that appears on html pages if the image fails to load.

Don't Example:

    Aaron TODO

## Definition of Done
I am supposed to create an array of objects from the information parse in and then change the data structure from a one dimenstional array of cities into an array of Country objects.


<!-- 
What is/are the project outcome(s)?
("Can you give me one sentence describing what you want done?")
We are trying to clean up the yard by Mow, Edge, and Rake.

Do Example:

    We are creating a tool to find all images that are in need of alt text in canvas which will automate this process by showing an image and prompting for alt text.

Don't Example:

# Requirements

### General Requirements

### Input Requirements

#### Definition of Inputs
It is a CSV file, The column names are: Country Name, State Name, Name, Population.

<!-- List here a type definition for each input. For example, if it is a CSV define the column names. If it is a JSON, give an example of the JSON structure. If it is user input, what will the user be asked for? -->

#### Source of Inputs

A file called citiesData.csv that I got off of github for this project.
<!-- Paragraph of how to get inputs. From who? From where: Slack, email, server...? This also includes user selected options at runtime. How will we know what options to select? For example, in conversion tool, you'd follow the values on the Trello Board. It would also include the steps to get access to the information you need, such as getting added to a Trello Board, or access to a server. -->

### Output Requirements

#### Definition of Outputs

<!-- List here a type definition for each output? For example, if the changes are directly to the LMS, list all changes that occur. If it is a CSV define the column names. If it is a JSON, give an example of the JSON structure. -->

#### Destination of Outputs
To a JSON file(?)
<!-- Paragraph where/who to send outputs. To who? To where: Email, server, directly to LMS...? It would also include the steps to get access to the locations you need, such as getting added to a Trello Board, or access to a server, or the LMS. -->

### User Interface

#### Type:

<!-- CLI with Flags, CLI With Prompt, Web Page, Server, Library, etc -->

<!-- What are the flags, what are Major Questions, Images of UX/UI Design. -->

-----

## Expectations

### Timeline
-Milestone 1: Parse the file, and put it into a 1 demensional array of objects (5/8)
-Milestone 2: Change the data structure from 1 demensional, basically nested arrays of objects.(5/10)
-Milestone 3: Write out to a JSON file(5/13)

<!-- Include Milestone List here with Deadlines and try to make each milestone a minimum viable product
- Milestone 1: Finish Design (3/19)
- Milestone 2: Build Core logic to search for words in syllabi (3/22)
- Milestone 3: Connect inputs to core logic and set up outputs (3/25)
- Milestone 4: Deliver the project (3/26)
This will probably be overkill for small projects -->
